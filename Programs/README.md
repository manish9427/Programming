#### Array

- Write a function in any programming language that takes an array of integers as input and returns the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. For example, if the input array is [1, 3, 7, 2, 9, 8], the function should return 8 (the difference between 1 and 9).

Note: The function should handle both positive and negative integers in the array.
